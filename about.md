Hello and welcome to my site. I'm Robert Davey and I'm a software developer. I currently work at [NetEDI][netedi], and in the past I've also worked at companies like [Thermo Fisher Scientific][thermo] and [BAE Systems][baesys].
In my day-to-day job I specialise in C# which I've been using now for over 10 years.

In my spare time though, my passion has been iOS and Mac development, and since Apple [announced][swift-intro] the [Swift][swift] programming language at [WWDC][wwdc] 2014, I've been hooked on the new language and the opportunities it affords.

On this website I will aim to share some of my programming knowledge. It will primarily be in [Swift][swift-org] but occasionally may include posts on C#, or other languages, and even random topics I wish to dicsuss.
